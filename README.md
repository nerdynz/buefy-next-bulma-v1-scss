## WIP: only datepicker and table is done right now. Use this as an example

# Development 
1. run `pnpm sass` and it will test a build and show any errors.
2. uncomment lines in _index.scss
3. work through the errors by manually searching through node_modules/buefy/sass (its quite readable once you get a feel for the import/use structure)

# Getting Started

1. import bulma
2. import this project



you can look at example.scss but **DO NOT USE THIS AS AN IMPORT** its better to use bulma in your own project and use sass.

Bulma sass starting point here
